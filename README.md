# I310D-Assignment-1
## Assignment 1: Data Collection & Curation

### Goal of this project:

To determine the median life expectancies of animals in North American zoos and aquariums, as well as gauge in which age range the death of zoo/aquarium animals is most common. To attempt to execute best practices for scientific research in designing and implementing. To make my findings fully reproducible by others.

### Data type and description for each attribute in the data:

**Species Common Name** <class 'str'>: Common species name of vertebrate animal in North American zoo and/or aquarium

**Scientific Name** <class 'str'>: Scientific species name of vertebrate animal in North American zoo and/or aquarium 

**Taxon Class** <class 'str'>: Describes which vertebrate taxa the species resides in

**Overall Sample Size** <class 'numpy.float64'>: Total recorded number of animals in that specific species

**Overall MLE**  <class 'numpy.float64'>: Overall median life expectancy of that specific species

**Male Sample Size** <class 'numpy.float64'>: Total number of male-classified animals for that specific species

**Male MLE** <class 'numpy.float64'>: Median life expectancy for male animals in a specifc species

**Female Sample Size** <class 'numpy.float64'>: Total number of female-classified animals for that specific species 

**Female MLE** <class 'numpy.float64'>: Median life expectancy for female animals in a specific species

### Any known issues or potential issues:

- The specific North American zoos & aquariums were not thoroughly specified by the source data description. Zoos and aquariums could have different policies on life expectancy situations, and since North America includes the United States and Canada, more detailed information about this could've been useful.
- Not completely sure how this data was collected and buy whom. Collectors of the source data could've been biased on what information they chose to include in this dataset.
