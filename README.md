Assignment 1: Data Collection & Curation

**Goal of this project:** To determine the median life expectancies of animals in North American zoos, as well as gauge in which age range the death of zoo animals is most common. To attempt to execute best practices for scientific research in designing and implementing. To make my findings fully reproducible by others.
